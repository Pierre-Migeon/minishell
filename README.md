# Pierre's Minishell Project

### As Beautiful as a Shell... 

This is the 42 project Minishell! The instructions are to build a shell that reads commands from a user and executes them. Several Shell builtins are required. The shell can also execute binaries available through the users path, and fork new processes to do so.

To check out my shell:

1. clone repository
2. run `make` (places copy of minishell in /usr/local/bin/
3. run `minishell` to launch the shell.
